    What if i could use NLP to tell my game how to proceed?<br>
    Find Bloodwyrm a quest, rerun quest hunting for items. etc<br>
    or use natural language to attack and advance combat.<br><br>

    check status<br>
    move forward cautiously<br>
    assess situation<br>
    "giothwyn the mage shouts that he senses a magic user in their midst" <br>4 small figures bear before you<br>
    what do you do?
    close quarters attack position, protect rear, ranged attack at will, stealth try to hide in the chaos attacking <br>
    rear, preserve spellpower<br>
    this is probably better from a solo standpoint...perhaps the solo general commands everybody, <br>
    the world is described from the point of view of the focus character, the rest are bots<br>
    armory, blades, arrows, wands, symbols
